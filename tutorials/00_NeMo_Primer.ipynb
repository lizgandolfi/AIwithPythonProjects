        "# Getting Started: Exploring Nemo Fundamentals\n",
        "\n",
        "NeMo is a toolkit for creating [Conversational AI](https://developer.nvidia.com/conversational-ai#started) applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "NeMo toolkit makes it possible for researchers to easily compose complex neural network architectures for conversational AI using reusable components - Neural Modules. Neural Modules are conceptual blocks of neural networks that take typed inputs and produce typed outputs. Such modules typically represent data layers, encoders, decoders, language models, loss functions, or methods of combining activations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The toolkit comes with extendable collections of pre-built modules and ready-to-use models for automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language processing (NLP) and text synthesis (TTS). Built for speed, NeMo can utilize NVIDIA's Tensor Cores and scale out training to multiple GPUs and multiple nodes.\n",

        "\n",
        "The NeMo Examples directory is structured by domain, as well as sub-task. Similar to how we partition the collections supported by NeMo, the examples themselves are separated initially by domain, and then by sub-tasks of that domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "All these example scripts are bound to at least one default config file. These config files contain all of the information of the model, as well as the PyTorch Lightning Trainer configuration and Experiment Manager configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, once the model is trained and saved to a PyTorch Lightning checkpoint, or to a .nemo tarfile, it will no longer contain the training configuration - no configuration information for the Trainer or Experiment Manager.\n",
        "\n",
        "**These config files have good defaults pre-set to run an experiment with NeMo, so it is advised to base your own training configuration on these configs.**\n",

        "NeMo also supports training Speech Recognition models with Byte Pair/Word Piece encoding of the corpus, via the `speech_to_text_ctc_bpe.py` example. Since these models are still under development, their configs fall under the `experimental/configs` directory.\n",
